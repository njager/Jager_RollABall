A version of the Unity Roll-A-Ball Tutorial game for Indiana University Instructor Ian Sundstrom's MSCH-G300 Game Production I course. 
Created by Nicholas Jager.

Modifications:
 -added a jump mechanic that only activates once a specific power up is collected.
 -added an innate sprint feature
 -added text when the jump pick up is collected
 -added obstacles that reduce a health count, shown in the HUD
 -expanded the level to include new platforms, an obstacle course platform, and difficult jump platforms at the end

 Playtesting:
    Three playtesters were observed. Based on their comments/experiences the difficulty of the end platforming was reduced, speed was increased, # of pick-ups was decreased, and tightness of controls (Speed + drag) was increased.
